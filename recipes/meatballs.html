        <h3>Descripton</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe for meatballs without sauce, if you want sauce I recommend it from a jar for an easy weeknight dinner</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Parigiano-Regianno</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound of ground meat (can be mixture or one type we use 50/50 pork and beef</li>
            <li>1 to 2 TBL high heat cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir breadcrumbs and milk in a large bowl, and then let sit for 5 minutes. Add the egg, cheese, oregano, salt and the pepper. Stir until well blended.</li>
            <li>Add the ground meat and use a fork or your fingers to gently mix everything until combined. For the most tender meatballs, try your best not to over mix.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands, and then form the mixture into small balls (1-inch to 1 ¼-inch balls). You should get about 35 meatballs. A small cookie scoop is useful for portioning out the meatballs.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, foil or a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>Place formed meatballs onto the baking sheet, leaving a little space in between each meatball.</li>
            <li>Lightly spray the top of the meatballs with cooking spray or brush with oil.</li>
            <li>Bake until they are cooked through, the outsides are browned, and they register 165°F in the middle on an instant-read thermometer; about 20 minutes.</li>

        </ol>
